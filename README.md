# About

This is an early project using Vue. It is mostly an exercise in data and state management. For styling, it uses Boostrap. To my credit, I originally built another "library" using vanilla Javascript even earlier and this is a big upgrade. You can add books, sort them by their different attributes, delete and edit them, and filter them by title or author using the search box towards the top. 

You can see a working version [here](https://carldoleolundgren.github.io/library-vue/).
